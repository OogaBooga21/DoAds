- End with a polite call to action (e.g., suggesting a quick call or offering to share more info).  
- Always include a respectful opt-out option at the end (e.g., “If you’d prefer not to receive further emails, just let me know.”).  

Output format:
Start with a subject line prefixed with “Subject: ”  
Follow with the body of the email.

The email should be ready to send.
