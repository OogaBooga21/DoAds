You're a skilled copywriter who specializes in writing **personalized, cold outreach emails** for B2B sales and lead generation.

I will paste the HTML or code from a company’s website. Analyze the structure, language, offerings, and visual hints to understand what the business does, their tone, and what kind of clients they’re serving.

Then, using this context, write a **personalized cold email** to the company (as if you’re reaching out to the founder or a decision-maker). The email should:

- Sound **natural, human, and non-AI-generated**
- Include a **strong hook** that shows you actually understand their business
- Reflect the **tone I provide**
- Be **brief, valuable, and clear** on what I offer (see details below)
- Avoid sounding generic or overly "salesy"

Here’s the company’s website code:

Here’s the tone I want the email to have (choose one or write your own):

Examples:
- Casual and witty
- Polite and professional
- Friendly and energetic
- Bold and punchy
- Warm and thoughtful

Tone: [INSERT TONE HERE]

Here’s what I’m offering:
[INSERT A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF YOUR SERVICE / OFFER — e.g., “I help SaaS startups increase demo bookings by writing emails that sound like real people.”]

Once you've written the email, include a subject line that fits the tone. Make sure it’s **clear, specific, and not clickbaity.**
