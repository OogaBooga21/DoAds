--- STRICT INSTRUCTIONS: FILTERS AND QUALITY CHECK ---

1.  **CRITICAL QUALITY/DOMAIN CHECK:** Before generating the email, analyze the overall content and business domain:
    a.  **LOW-QUALITY/INCOMPLETE:** IF the provided Business information is too short, low-quality, or consists mostly of placeholder text, your ENTIRE output must be the single keyword: **INCOMPLETE$$$$$INCOMPLETE#####INCOMPLETE**. Do NOT generate an email.
    b.  **MARKETING AGENCY FILTER:** IF the company's primary activity is clearly a **Marketing Agency, SEO Company** your ENTIRE output must be the single keyword: **MARKETING_AGENCY$$$$$MARKETING_AGENCY#####MARKETING_AGENCY**. Do NOT generate an email.

2.  **GREETING LOGIC:**
    * First, try to identify a person's name (e.g., near 'CEO', 'Founder', or on the contact/team pages). If a reliable name is found, use it (e.g., 'Hello [Name],').
    * If no reliable name is found, use the full business name (e.g., 'Hello [Company Name] Team,').
    * If the company name is unclear or generic, use a generic greeting like **'Hello,'** or **'Salut,'**.
    * **CRITICAL:** Explicitly ignore placeholder text like `[NAME]`, `[NUME]`, `[COMPANY]`, or generic "Contact Person".

Tone to use:
[INSERT TONE HERE]

Guidelines:
- Personalize the email using details about the business where relevant.
- **CONTEXT PRIORITIZATION:** When analyzing the content:
    * **For E-commerce:** Determine the **theme or niche** of the shop (e.g., handmade jewelry, sustainable pet supplies), and focus on that general concept, *not* on individual, specific products.
    * **For Journals/News Sites:** Determine the **general focus** (e.g., local politics, tech reviews, financial news), and focus on that scope, *not* on the details of one recent article.
    * Prioritize content from the `CORE CONTEXT` and `PRODUCTS/SERVICES` sections.
- **EMAIL FLOW:** Dedicate the **first paragraph** (or main starting focus) to the **client's business and context**, making a tailored observation and connecting it to the offer. Introduce your offer and credentials in the second paragraph. **Focus on the client first.**
- Useful details may include (if available from the scraped content):
  • The company’s mission or vision  
  • Their products or services  
  • Recent news, updates, or announcements  
  • Team size, leadership, or culture  
  • Industries or clients they serve  
  • Unique approaches, technologies, or differentiators  
  • Locations or offices mentioned  
- Naturally connect the offer to the business’s context in a way that feels tailored.
- Make the email flow like a genuine human conversation, not a template.
- Do NOT use emojis, bullet points, numbered lists, or em dashes.
- End with a polite call to action (e.g., suggesting a quick call or offering to share more info).
- Always include a respectful opt-out option at the end (e.g., “If you’d prefer not to receive further emails, just let me know.”).
- Carefully examine information scraped from the website, identify the most important/relevant details, and rank them in a list of 5-7 elements.

Output format:
Start with a subject line. The subject MUST be personalized, clear, and designed to generate curiosity or state a clear benefit to the client
Follow with the body of the email.

After the relevant information section use the specific operator "#####" and to add the activity domain of the company
